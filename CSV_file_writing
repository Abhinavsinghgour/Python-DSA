# ====================================================   
# Q. Create a csv file and write entries in it with predefined column name?

# Solution : 

# Code explanation :

#                 >>>>     writer.writerow({"name": name , "home": home})       <<<<


# Action: above line uses the "DictWriter" object to write a new row of data to the CSV file.

# writer.writerow(...): This method expects a Python dictionary as its input.

# {"name": name , "home": home}: This dictionary maps the header names defined in fieldnames ("name" and "home") to the variables containing the user's input (name and home).

# Result: The DictWriter looks up the values in the dictionary, puts them in the correct column order, and writes the final, formatted line into name.csv.

import csv

name=input("Enter name :")
home=input("Enter home Address :")

with open("name.csv", "a") as file:
    writer=csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=["name","home"])
    writer.writerow({"name": name , "home": home})
